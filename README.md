# Lectern Undead Players

This Lectern module introduces a new twist to death. Now, when you die, a
zombified version of you will stay behind, picking up your full inventory.

If you want your loot back, you'll need to fight your own corpse! Watch out,
though, because it will use your best sword and equip your strongest armor.
Thankfully, Undead Players do not know how to use bows or tridents...

Wait--what happens when one drowns?
